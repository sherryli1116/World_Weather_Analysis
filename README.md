# World_Weather_Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collect, analyze and visualize weather data across cities worldwide and to provide travelers with a tool that would allow us to determine the travel destination based on weather conditions we filtered out in the previous steps. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, we used the Google Maps Directions API, we created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
